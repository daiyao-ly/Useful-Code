是先去logistics tracking tab裡面抓location
wh_location AS (
   SELECT *
   FROM
     (
      SELECT
        log_id
      , location
      , "row_number"() OVER (PARTITION BY log_id ORDER BY update_time ASC) rn
      FROM
        shopee.shopee_sls_logistic_sg_db__logistic_tracking_tab
      WHERE ((status = 2) AND (location <> ''))
UNION ALL       SELECT
        log_id
      , location
      , "row_number"() OVER (PARTITION BY log_id ORDER BY update_time ASC) rn
      FROM
        shopee.shopee_sls_logistic_my_db__logistic_tracking_tab
      WHERE ((status = 2) AND (location <> ''))
UNION ALL       SELECT
        log_id
      , location
      , "row_number"() OVER (PARTITION BY log_id ORDER BY update_time ASC) rn
      FROM
        shopee.shopee_sls_logistic_tw_db__logistic_tracking_tab
      WHERE ((status = 2) AND (location <> ''))
UNION ALL       SELECT
        log_id
      , location
      , "row_number"() OVER (PARTITION BY log_id ORDER BY update_time ASC) rn
      FROM
        shopee.shopee_sls_logistic_id_db__logistic_tracking_tab
      WHERE ((status = 2) AND (location <> ''))
UNION ALL       SELECT
        log_id
      , location
      , "row_number"() OVER (PARTITION BY log_id ORDER BY update_time ASC) rn
      FROM
        shopee.shopee_sls_logistic_th_db__logistic_tracking_tab
      WHERE ((status = 2) AND (location <> ''))
UNION ALL       SELECT
        log_id
      , location
      , "row_number"() OVER (PARTITION BY log_id ORDER BY update_time ASC) rn
      FROM
        shopee.shopee_sls_logistic_ph_db__logistic_tracking_tab
      WHERE ((status = 2) AND (location <> ''))
UNION ALL       SELECT
        log_id
      , location
      , "row_number"() OVER (PARTITION BY log_id ORDER BY update_time ASC) rn
      FROM
        shopee.shopee_sls_logistic_vn_db__logistic_tracking_tab
      WHERE ((status = 2) AND (location <> ''))
UNION ALL       SELECT
        log_id
      , location
      , "row_number"() OVER (PARTITION BY log_id ORDER BY update_time ASC) rn
      FROM
        shopee.shopee_sls_logistic_br_db__logistic_tracking_tab
      WHERE ((status = 2) AND (location <> ''))
   ) 
   WHERE (rn = 1)
   
   
   然後用location判斷
   CASE WHEN lower(wh_location.location) in ('shiyan', 'jiehe', 'shenzhen') then 'TWS01'
				WHEN lower(wh_location.location) in ('hongkong') then 'TWS02'
				WHEN lower(wh_location.location) in ('shanghai', 'sh') then 'ECP01-Shanghai'
				WHEN lower(wh_location.location) in ('yiwu', 'yw') then 'ECP01-Yiwu'
				WHEN lower(wh_location.location) in ('quanzhou', 'qz') then 'ECP01-Quanzhou'
				WHEN lower(wh_location.location) in ('korea') then 'TWS03'
			END AS whs_code
