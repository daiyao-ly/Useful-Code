[PH] Zone C ESF reduction proposals

The alignment is to go for Proposal A (without adjusting hidden fee): Lower Zone C ESF from 70 to 40. CNCB P&L will be at 96%.

CB ESF in all zones is lower than LGS ESF. CB ESF in Zone B, C, D are also lower than Local ESF.

Propose to launch Zone C ESF reduction on 10 May when Vismin direct injection project goes live.
